Build Number 5.20162.192              Build Date: 07/12/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Angular 2: added support for Angular forms. The ngForms sample demonstrates the 
	  feature.
	  The implementation is based on the *new* forms implementation from the @angular/forms 
	  module, instead of *deprecated* forms stuff from the @angular/common module – 
	  see the documentation on the new forms stuff here: 
	  https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/forms.html .
	  The dynamic forms scenario described here
	  https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/dynamic-form.html
	  is supported as well. The ngForms sample includes the modified
	  version of the abovementioned Dynamic Forms example that uses
	  Wijmo input components.
	- Angular 2: tested against RC.4.
	- Added a few class names to FlexGrid elements to enable more flexible CSS-based
	  styling. The new class names are:
        wj-elem-collapse  Element that holds the expand/collapse glyphs in group rows
        wj-elem-dropdown  Element that holds the drop-down glyph in data-mapped cells
        wj-elem-filter    Element that holds the filter glyph in column headers
	- Added a "wj-autocomplete-match" class to define the default style used for 
	  highlighting AutoComplete matches (can be overridden by the cssClass property).
	- Added an AutoComplete.searchMemberPath property that allows you to specify 
	  item properties to use when searching (in addition to displayMemberPath).
	- Added an 'isReadOnly' property to all input controls (DropDown, InputNumber, Calendar).
	  This prevents users from changing the value, but still allows selection, focus, and events.
      It is equivalent to the 'readonly' property in HTML input elements, but also prevents
	  editing with the mouse (drop-downs, buttons, wheel).
	- Added a selectionMode property to the InputDate and Calendar controls to allow 
	  selecting months rather than specific days.
	- Added specific class names to derived controls (for example, the ComboBox control host
	  element now has class wj-combobox in addition to wj-control and wj-dropdown).
	- Improved CSS to keep InputDate calendar width constant as the user navigates months
	  in IE.
	- Made input controls switch the 'for' attribute of labels targeting the host element 
	  so they target the inner input element instead. For example:
	      <label for="inputDate">Departure:</label>
	      <wj-input-date id="inputDate"></wj-input-date>
	  The InputDate will automatically set the id to its inner input element to 'inputDate.input'
	  and will switch the "for" attribute of the label to target the input element instead.
	- Added undo/redo processing for inserting/removing chart in FlexSheet. (TFS 191085)
	- Added a new 'wj-state-empty' class to controls that contains empty input elements.
	  This class can be used in CSS selectors along with the wj-state-focused class.
	- Allow empty strings on masked inputs when "isRequired" is false.

* Breaking changes
	- Replaced some custom attributes used by the FlexGrid control with class names 
	  for better W3C compliance and CSS support:
		"wj-collapse" attribute was replaced with "wj-elem-collapse" class name
		"wj-dropdown" attribute was replaced with "wj-elem-dropdown" class name
		"wj-filter" attribute was replaced with "wj-elem-filter" class name
	  This change may affect applications that customize the display of node cells.
	  For example, you should replace:
		cell.innerHTML = '<span wj-collapse class="glyphicon ...
	  With
		cell.innerHTML = '<span class="wj-elem-collapse glyphicon ...
	- Deprecated 'disabled' and 'required' properties on all controls and replaced them
	  with 'isDisabled' and 'isRequired'. This avoids conflicts with HTML attributes
	  in markup. The old properties still work, but will be removed in a future release,
	  so this is not a breaking change yet, but will be.

* Bug fixes
	- 'Year Quarter' and 'Fiscal Year Quarter' formats cannot be exported correctly to XLSX 
	  file. (TFS 197681)

Build Number 5.20162.188              Build Date: 06/29/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added wijmo.chart.hierarchical.Sunburst control. The control displays hierarhical 
	  data as multi-level pie charts.
	- Added wijmo.chart.analytics.Waterfall class. The Waterfall series represents data
	  values with cumulative effects(Waterfall chart).
	- wijmo.pdf - added support for drawing SVG images (the PdfPageArea.drawSvg method).
	- Added customized filter for FlexSheet, make the filtering behave exactly like in Excel.
	- Updated the cell ranges processing in formula that Insert/delete row/column will update 
	  affected cell ranges in formulas.
	- Added a CollectionView.sortComparer property to support using custom value 
	  comparers such as Dave Koele's "natural sorting": http://www.davekoelle.com/alphanum.html
	- Added JavaScript Intellisense support, see the Intellisense folder in Wijmo zip.
	- Angular 2 - adapted to Angular 2 RC.3
	- Angular 2: the 'initialized' event and 'isInitialized' boolean property are added
	  to all components. The event triggers when the bindings on the component and all
	  its child components have been initialized, and the property changes its value
	  from false to true at this moment.
	  Note that 'isInitialized' is a dynamic property, in a sense is that it's not 
	  exposed as a TypeScript property out of the component interface, so it should be
	  read using the component['isInitialized'] syntax.

* Bug fixes
	- When undo the current cell in editing mode with 'Ctrl + Z', original value is not 
	  restored in editing cell. (TFS 189582)
	- Filtering by conditions (Equals and Does not equal) is not working correctly in Date,
	  Numeric and Checkbox columns. (TFS 190543)
	- Angular 1/2: FlexGrid row heights may grow infinitely if grid performs cells merging
	  and uses cell templates.
	- FlexSheet Filter values list does not include only items that are not excluded by 
	  other filters like FlexGrid. (TFS 194375)
	- FlexSheet Filtering is cleared unintentionally in unbound sheet when insert/delete 
	  column or row. (TFS 194311)
	- Sheets navigation is not working correctly when there is many sheets and direction 
	  of the FlexSheet is Right To Left. (TFS 192724)
	- FlexSheet filtering is cleared unintentionally when sorting a column. (TFS 195517)
	- Formula drop-down cannot be opened by entering "=" if SelectionMode is set to 
	  non-default value. (TFS 195513)
	- Sheet tabs and new sheet tab are not able to see in Right to Left sheet. (TFS 196273)
	- Incorrect values are shown in formula cells when delete a cell from formula cell 
	  range. (TFS 197166)
	- Undo/redo action cannot be done at once after Inserting/deleting rows/columns like 
	  MS-Excel. (TFS 197005)
	- Sheets navigation is not working correctly in IE and FireFox when there is many 
	  sheets and direction of the FlexSheet is Right To Left. (TFS 192724)

	  cells in the Worksheet for exporting.
	- Added PivotGrid.showRowFieldSort property. See this thread for details:
	  http://wijmo.com/topic/pivotgrid-rowfield-columns-do-not-respect-allowsorting-or-showsort/#post-75360
	- Added MultiSelect.checkedItems property to Angular directives.
	- Added Popup.dialogResult and Popup.dialogResultEnter properties to make it easier 
	  to create and handle modal dialogs.

* Bug fixes
	- 'Freeze' icon in toolbar did not refresh when freezing is applied in FlexSheet in
	  ExcelBook Ng2 sample. (TFS 152308)

	- When select chart on the sheet, cell range selection was lost. (TFS 152995)
	- FlexSheet control loaded date formats incorrectly if system's time zone contains
	  daylight time. (TFS 153785)
	- Dates falling in Daylight savings time zone was exported incorrectly. (TFS 147908)
	- Undo/Redo does not work correctly when input 2 or more formulas into the sheet.
	  (TFS 189042)
	- Column-header and row-header of previous selected cell was highlight even when 
	  current selection is changed. (TFS 189050)
	- Context-menu of the browser did not pop up in editing cell. (TFS 189340)
	- When undo the current cell in editing mode, original value was not restored in 
	  editing cell. (TFS 189582)

	- Groups did not collapse/expand and columns are were not resizeable after freezing
	  the pane. (TFS 190311)
	- Script errors occur when 'wijmo.grid.sheet.filter.min.js' is not included as script
	  reference in Benchmark sample. (TFS 190312)
	- Multiple console errors are observed and empty sheet is displayed in Ng2 ExcelBook,
	  FlexSheetIntro and FlexSheetExplorer sample. (TFS 190260)

	- 'Cut' operation is not able to do in the FlexSheet like MS Excel. (TFS 191694)

* Breaking changes
	- The CollectionView.moveCurrentToPrevious method used to allow moving the cursor to
	  position -1. Now it stops moving when the cursor reaches the first item (position zero).
	  This was done for two reasons:
	  1) To make the method more convenient to use in typical first/prev/next/last VCR-style 
	     navigation buttons (the 'prev' button can now be linked to moveCurrentToPrevious 
		 without any additional tests), and
	  2) To improve consistency with the moveCurrentToNext method, which stopped at the last 
	     item in the collection.

* Improvements
	- Added an ODataCollectionView.load method to re-fetch the data from the server. (TFS 139722)
	- Added CollectionView.sourceCollectionChanging and CollectionView.sourceCollectionChanged events.
	- Added support for deleting the content of multiple cells on the FlexSheet. (TFS 139728)

* Improvements
	- Improved keyboard/focus handling in Popup control (TFS 148651)
	- Improved the FlexGridFilter value filters to behave more like Excel (TFS 133354)
	  The values shown for a column include only items that are not excluded by other filters. 
	  For example, if you filter a list by 'name' and that results in two items being shown, 
	  other field filters will only show the values of those two items.
	- Added new settings to AllowResizing enum to allow resizing rows and columns by
	  dragging the edges of scrollable (non-header) cells. This is especially useful when
	  headers are hidden (see headersVisibility). The updated settings are
		export enum AllowResizing {
	        None
			Columns,
			Rows,
			Both,
			ColumnsAllCells, // resize columns by dragging cell edges
			RowsAllCells,	 // resize rows by dragging cell edges
			BothAllCells	 // resize rows and columns by dragging cell edges

Build Number 5.20161.138              Build Date: 03/10/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added wijmo.angular2.* modules (Beta version), that allow to use Wijmo 
	  controls in Angular 2 applications markup.
    - Added a wijmo.chart.animation module with the ChartAnimation main class that
      provides animations for the FlexChart, FlexPie and FinancialChart controls.
      The FlexChartAnimation sample demonstrates module's features.
    - Added ChartGestures to the wijmo.chart.interaction module. The class adds 
	  touch zoom and panning functionality to the FlexChart control.
      The FlexChartZoom sample demonstrates usage of the class.

      side functionality for creating files in PDF format. The module is based on a 
      modified version of the PDFKit library (http://pdfkit.org/) with a footprint
      minified up to 375Kb.
    - Added wijmo.grid.pdf module which is an extension of the wijmo.pdf and
      wijmo.grid modules and provides functionality for exporting FlexGrid to
      PDF format.
	- Added a PrintDocument class to the wijmo module. This class allows you to create
	  documents for printing, which in modern browsers includes the option to export
	  to PDF.
	- Modified FlexGridFilter module to clear value filters when all possible values 
	  are selected.
	- Added a FlexGrid.preserveSelectedState property to control whether the grid
	  should preserve the selected state of rows when the data is refreshed.
	- Added a FlexGrid.preserveOutlineState property to control whether the grid
	  should preserve the collapsed/expanded state of group rows when the data is 
	  refreshed.
	- Added a Tooltip.showAtMouse property that causes the tooltip position to be
	  computed based on the mouse position rather than on the target element.
	- Made FlexGrid "stickyHeaders" visible to the mouse, so users can interact
	  with columns (sort/move/resize/filter) while in sticky mode.
    - Added FlexSheetExplorer sample.

Build Number 5.20153.112              Build Date: 01/16/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added a new InputDateTime control to enter/edit date and time values using a
	  single control (as opposed to using an InputDate and an InputTime).
	- Added a new FlexGrid.imeEnbled property to support IME modes while the grid
	  is not in edit mode. This property benefits sites and applications in Japanese,
	  Chinese, Korean and other languages that require IME support.
	- Improved FlexGrid.focus() implementation to prevent the browser from scrolling 
	  the grid's hostElement into view when the grid gets the focus.
	- Improved allowAddNew to work better with childItemsPath.
	- Improved IE9 polyfill to support drag/drop in modal dialogs (TFS 140812)
    - Added Angular 2 Explorer sample with components for core Wijmo controls. The 
      sample uses Beta.1 version of Angular 2.
    - wijmo.xlsx
        -- Added support for several new functions:
            Column
            Columns
            COUNTA
            COUNTBLANK
            COUNTIF

            SUMIF
            SUMIFS
            TIME
            TODAY 
        -- Added support for importing shared formulas.
        -- Improved performance.
    - wijmo.grid.sheet 
        -- Added support for user-provided custom functions, see the 
           FlexSheet.addCustomFunction method.
        -- Added FlexSheet.unknownFunction event that allows to process
           non-supported functions found in cell expressions.
        -- Added Sheet.itemsSource property that allows to change the items
           source for data bound sheets.
	- Added a wijmo.input.DropDown.dropDownCssClass property to make it easier to style
	  the drop-down elements of the controls (this applies to all controls that extend
	  DropDown, including ComboBox, MultiSelect, InputDate, InputTime, etc).
	- Added a wijmo.grid.Column.dropDownCssClass property to make it easier to style
	  the drop-down list used to edit cells in columns that have dataMaps.
	- Added a wijmo.collections.CollectionView.useStableSort property that causes the
	  CollectionView class to use a stable sort algorithm which is 30 to 50% slower
	  than the native sort but maintains the relative order of records with equal keys.

* Breaking changes
    - The wijmo.xlsx.XlsxConverter class is deprecated. Use the wijmo.xlsx.Workbook
      class instead. XlsxConverter is still supported for compatibility and will be
      eliminated in the future releases.
    - wijmo.grid.xlsx.FlexGridXlsxConverter class:
        -- the 'export', 'toWorkbookOM', 'import' and 'fromWorkbookOM' methods are deprecated.
           Use the 'save' and 'load' methods instead. The old methods are still supported for 
           compatibility and will be eliminated in the future releases.
    - wijmo.grid.sheet.FlexSheet class:
        -- saveToWorkbookOM and loadFromWorkbookOM methods are deprecated. 
           Use the 'save' and 'load' methods instead. The old methods are still supported for 
           compatibility and will be eliminated in the future releases.
	- CellRangeEventArgs class: removed property "cellRange", which was deprecated 
	  in build 105 and replaced by "range".
	- HitTestInfo class: removed property "gridPanel", which was deprecated 
	  in build 105 and replaced by "panel".

* Bug fixes
	- Fixed grid to to include all items and sub-items in aggregates (TFS 139570,
	  partially fixed earlier in build 5.20143.35)

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20153.109              Build Date: 12/10/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Improved CollectionView.trackChanges to allow tracking of changes made to items
	  that are not the current edit item. The most common scenario is pasting blocks
	  of data into a FlexGrid.
	- Improved FlexGrid.childItemsPath property to accept arrays of strings in case
	  items at different levels use different property names for their child items.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20153.108              Build Date: 12/06/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Changed the default value of the InputTime.step property to 15 (which seems
	  to be the most common/useful setting). This causes the control to display
	  the drop-down button by default; to remove the button, set the step property
	  to null.
	- Added support for opening FlexGrid.dataMap dropdowns using the keyboard
	  (F4, alt+up/down, like WinForms and WPF/Excel) (TFS 124408)
	- Improved the Control.dispose method to remove all Wijmo event listeners from the control
	  being disposed (dispose also removes all HTML event listeners added with the 
	  Control.addEventListener method).
	- Added a DropDown.autoExpandSelection property that determines whether input 
	  controls should automatically select whole words/numbers when clicked.
	  This applies to all controls that derive from DropDown, and makes it easier
	  to edit dates, times, colors, etc.
	- Added a ComboBox.headerPath property that allows decoupling the values shown in
	  the combo's input element from the values shown in the drop-down list.
	- Improved Globalize to support formatting of fiscal years and quarters with the 
	  following format specifiers:
		- 'EEEE': government fiscal year
		- 'eeee': corporations fiscal year
		- 'U': government fiscal quarter
		- 'u': corporations fiscal quarter
	  The conversion from calendar to fiscal date is culture-dependent. If you are 
	  not using the appropriate culture file (and don't want to), then you can 
	  specify the conversion factor by setting the 
	  wijmo.culture.Globalize.calendar.fiscalYearOffset variable to an array
	  containing two integers that represent the offset (in months) of the start of 
	  the fiscal year for government and for the private sector.
	  For example, the Japanese culture uses a three month offset for the government's
	  fiscal year and no offset for the private sector:
	      wijmo.culture.Globalize.calendar.fiscalYearOffsets = [3, 0];
    - Added five new glyphs to wijmo.css:
		wj-glyph-step-forward
		wj-glyph-step-backward
		wj-glyph-file
		wj-glyph-calendar
		wj-glyph-clock
	- Added automatic label rotation for FlexChart category x-axis. The labels are 
	  rotated to avoid overlapping if axis.labelAngle is not specified.	
	- Used IntelliSpell to spell-check all the documentation.
    - The FlexGridXlsxConverter class now supports row headers export. The behavior
      is controlled by the IFlexGridXlsxExportOptions.includeRowHeaders property.

* Breaking changes
    - wijmo.grid.xlsx module, the IFlexGridXlsxExportOptions interface:
        - 'needGetCellStyle' property has been renamed to 'includeCellStyles'. 
        - 'includeColumnHeader' property has been renamed to 'includeColumnHeaders' (ending 's'). 
      The old property names have been deprecated and will be removed in future builds.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20153.105              Build Date: 11/17/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Improved InputMask handling of delete key with masks that contain numbers in the
	  template (e.g. "99-55-9999", TFS 136087).
	- Add minScale/maxScale to RangeSelector extension for controlling the valid range.
	- Added FlexGrid.selectedRows and selectedItems properties. Both can be used to get
	  a list with the currently selected rows or their associated data items. When the
	  selectionMode property is set to ListBox, they can also be used to set the selected 
	  rows or data items.
	- Refactored wijmo.grid.filter.FlexGrid filter by removing the OData-specific 
	  getODataFilterDefinition method and replacing it with a call to the collection
	  view's updateFilterDefinition method; which if present updates the filter definition
	  used on the server-side. This refactoring allows other CollectionView implementations
	  (such as BreezeCollectionView) to support server-side filtering.
	- Improved BreezeCollectionView sample to show server-side filtering (TFS 129832).
	- Added support for Japanese characters (IME, Katakana, Hiragana) in InputMask control.
	- Added a FlexGrid.showAlternatingRows property to allow disabling alternate row
	  styling without changing any CSS rules.
	- Added a FlexGrid.updatedView event that fires when the grid finishes creating/updating 
	  the cell elements for the current view (e.g. after binding, refreshing, resizing, 
	  scrolling, etc.)

* Bug fixes
	- InputDate control did not preserve the time part of the value being edited.

	- New Fibonacci Extensions for FinancialChart: Fans, Arcs, Time zones.
	- Improved wijmo.grid.filter.FlexGridFilter to allow filtering with merged headers.
	- Improved auto-generated column headers.
	  (we now capitalize first letter, break up camel-case binding strings, so the header
	  for a column bound to the 'productName' property becomes 'Product Name' be default).
    - Optimized wijmo.closest method to use 'matches' method instead of 'querySelectorAll'.
	- Improved InputNumber control behavior on mobile devices.
    - Added a FlexGrid.stickyHeaders property that keeps column header cells in view
	  even when the top of the grid scrolls off view.
	- Improved CollectionView change tracking to ignore items that are added and 
	  subsequently removed in the same session.
	- Improved Globalize to support formatting of date quarters with the 'q' or 'Q'
	  format specifiers (e.g. format(someDate, 'yyyy "Q"q') => '2014 Q4').

* Improvements
	- Added FlexGrid.pastingCell/pastedCell events. These events fire while the grid 
	  is pasting data into individual cells. Previously, the grid would fire editing
	  events in these situations, but that led to some ambiguities that affected the
	  implementation of custom editors.

=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved Angular FlexGrid.CellEdit template to use the character that was typed
	  when initiating the edits (as the built-in editors do).
	- Added a wijmo.odata.ODataVirtualCollectionView class that loads data on demand.
	  See the VirtualData sample for details.
	- ODataCollectionView.filterDefinition property is applied to filter on the server
	  even when filterOnServer is set to false. This allows applications to apply 
	  server and client-side filtering to the same collection.
	- Made FlexGrid.cellFactory property get/set.
	- Added a wijmo.grid.DataMap.isEditable property to allow users to enter data that
	  is not on the DataMap (mapped items become non-exclusive options).

      directives inside it, and can be used in conjunction with ng-repeat/ng-if
      directives.
    - Data-bound Menu controls now support wj-item-template directive that allows to
      define an arbitrary menu item content.
    - ng-class AngularJS directive is now supported on the wj-flex-grid-column and
      wj-flex-grid-cell-template directives.

* Bug fixes
	- CollectionView.removeAt method issued a notification event with index==-1 instead
	  of the original index of the item that was removed.
	- FlexGrid MergeManager did not always behave consistently when merging ranges that
	  included both row and column merging (TFS 129001)

* Breaking changes
    - Wijmo directives for AngularJS no longer update controller properties bound to 
      by-ref ('=') properties that logically suppose one-way binding.


=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20152.84              Build Date: 08/27/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added a FlexGrid.showMarquee property that determines whether the grid should display
	  an Excel-style marquee around the current selection. The marquee may be styled using
	  the "wj-marquee" class selector.
	- Added a FlexGrid.showSelectedHeaders property that determines whether the grid should 
	  add a "wj-state-multi-selected" class selector to row and/or column header elements;
	  these can be used in CSS to highlight header cells that correspond to the current selection.
	- Added a new 'clip' parameter to the FlexGrid.getMergedRange method; if true (the default), 
	  the method clips the merged range to the current view range.
	  The 'clip' parameter has no effect on grid; it was added to facilitate the development 
	  of export utilities, which may need to get merged ranges that are not clipped to the 
	  grid's current view range.
	- Added Calendar.itemValidator and InputDate.itemValidator properties to enable preventing
	  certain days from being selected.
	- Added a Calendar.formatItem event to complement the Calendar.itemFormatter property.
	- LinearGauge now accounts for thumbSize when dimensioning the gauge's face.

* Bug fixes
	- Improved touch support in editable Gauges.
	- Fixed problem with chart type initialization in constructor parameter(TFS 125747).
    - Pie chart labels displayed correctly when it's position = 'Outside'(TFS 125423).
	- Chart does not change color's alpha if it was specified as rgba in palette (TFS 119543).

* Breaking changes

	- We made a small change to the logic that assigns classes to FlexGrid cells. Before, we 
	  removed the wj-group class from selected cells. That is no longer the case. There are 
	  two reasons for this change:

	  1) Correctness. Group cells remain group cells even when they are selected. Keeping the
	     wj-group class allows you to use CSS to style grouped and selected cells independently.
	  2) Performance. The new code is (very slightly) more efficient.

	  This change could break your custom FlexGrid CSS. If you have CSS rules that affect group 
	  colors they should be modified to exclude selected cells. In other words, if you had a 
	  rule like this:

		.wj-group {
			background: green;
		}

	  You should change it to this:

		.wj-group:not(.wj-state-selected):not(.wj-state-multi-selected) {
			background: green;
		}

Build Number 5.20152.76              Build Date: 08/13/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added a new 'wj-state-focused' class to controls that contains the focus. This 
	  class is toggled automatically to reflect the control's focus state and can be 
	  used in CSS selectors to add focus-related styles to parts of focused controls,
	  such as gauge cursors, chart series, and grid ranges.
    - Added Angular attributes for chart series axisX and axisY (TFS 122055).
	- Added wijmo.input.DropDown.isDroppedDownChanging event to allow for customization
	  of the drop-down before it is shown.
	- Added wijmo.grid.filter.ValueFiler.uniqueValues property to specify the list of values 
	  to be shown on the list, which is more efficient than building the list from the data
	  and works on collections that are filtered on the server.
    - Improved features and performance of Globalize.formatDate and parseDate methods.
	- Added scaling specifiers to Globalization.formatNumber and parseFloat. For example,
	  'n0,' divides the value by one thousand, 'n0,,' by one million, and 'n0,,,' by one 
	  billion. The scaling specifiers are especially useful in charts based on large values
	  so the axis display scaled values which are easier to read and take up less space.
	- Added a Gauge.thumbSize property that enables displaying a 'thumb' element to show
	  the current value at the end of the 'pointer' range. This applies to linear and 
	  radial gauges.
	- Added mouse wheel support to editable Gauges.

* Bug fixes
	- Prevented AutoComplete from selecting all the text while the user types.

    - Fixed problem with major and minor grid lines for category x-axis(TFS 110250).
    - Chart updated correctly after changing axis 'reversed' property(TFS 100492).
    - Added angular attribute for axis 'overlappingLabels' property(TFS 98919).

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20151.42          Build Date: 03/17/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Optimized grid scrolling performance.
    - Added markers to indicate the position of rows and columns being dragged.
    - Improved behavior of drop-down grid cells on mobile devices.
    - Added select-all functionality when the user clicks the top-left fixed cell.
    - Changed row and column resize cursors to 'col-resize' and 'row-resize.'

    - Added a Column.sortMemberPath property to sort columns based on an alternate binding.
    - Exposed wijmo.showPopup and hidePopup utility methods for positioning popup elements.
    - Added support for multi-item selection in the ListBox control. Set the checkedMemberPath 
      property to the name of a Boolean property in the itemsSource collection and the 
      ListBox adds checkboxes to each item, and fires the itemChecked event when
      the current item is checked or unchecked.
    - Deprecated and removed the wijmo.isTouchDevice method. The method
      actually tested the browser, not the device, so it was useless.
    - Added a LineMarker class to the wijmo.chart module that provides FlexChart with a 
      continuous data point information with optional directional lines  
      as mouse pointer moves over a chart surface.
    - Added a wijmo.chart.interaction extension module with a RangeSelector class
      that allows the user to choose the range of data to display on the specified FlexChart.
    - Added WjFlexGridCellTemplate directive for Angular that allows to define
      a custom template for any type of a FlexGrid cell (column and row headers,
      editing cell, and so on).
    - Cell templates now support element level directives.
    - Wijmo child directives for Angular (like WjFlexGridColumn or WjFlexChartSeries),
      when used in conjunction with ng-repeat directive, now support full-functional
      synchronization with ng-repeat's source array, including items order.

* Bug fixes
    - Fixed issues related to 'focusout,' which is not supported in FireFox.
    - Fixed FlexGrid.getCellBoundingRect so that it works correctly when dir="RTL."
    - Fixed a problem in chart selection when using itemFormatter.
    - Fixed the Clipboard so that it works on Apple OS (detects the 'Apple' key).
    - HitTestInfo.item returns correct value when chart is bounded to CollectionView.
    - Fixed rendering of merged cells when there are frozen areas (TFS 110627).
    - Fixed handling of IME text in ComboBox when isEditable = false (TFS 108547).

Build Number 5.20143.39        Build Date: 02/23/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added a FlexGrid.sortRowIndex property. This property determines the index of 
      the row in the column headers panel that displays the sort icon and can be clicked
      to sort the column. By default, it is set to null, causing the last row in the 
      panel to be the 'sort row.'
    - Raise editing events when pasting data into the FlexGrid (this allows users to
      prevent overwriting of specific cells when pasting).
    - Improved column filters to work with complex properties (e.g. 'state.name', 'state.pop').
    - Exposed wijmo.Binding class used to work with complex properties.

* Bug fixes
    - Fixed several problems with rendering mixed chart types (TFS 96721, 98617).
    - Made pie chart handle negative data values correctly (TFS 89936).
    - Fixed a problem with the pie chart tooltip for the selected slice (TFS 108871).
    - Fixed a problem with chart tooltips in IE11 (TFS 109876).
    - Fixed InputMask cursor positioning on Safari (TFS 109969, 102148, 96927).
    - Fixed aggregate so that it updates correctly after adding new rows (TFS 109119).
    - Improved date/time detection in the FlexGridFilter editor (TFS 109409).
    - Prevented users from dragging rows below the new row template (TFS 109012).
    - Fixed RTL layout so that it works properly in Safari (TFS 109371).
    - Fixed cell templates so that they are honored in GroupRows (regression).
    - Fixed a problem with dropdown controls on mobile browsers.
    - Fixed Wijmo directives for Angular so that they work with the ng-inspector tool.

=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added wijmo.grid.grouppanel module with the GroupPanel control to provide drag&drop
      grouping functionality to the FlexGrid control.
    - Improved the CollectionView sorting logic to place nulls at the bottom of the list,
      regardless of sort direction (Excel behavior).
    - Allow initialization of ObservableArray in constructor.
    - Improved formatting of values in GroupRow node cells.
* Bug fixes
    - The data labels are not visible for data points outside plot area (TFS 109293).
    - Fixed problem with stacked charts when first series has custom chart type (TFS 107530).
    - Fixed problem with FlexGrid.autoSizeRows in grids with word-wrapping and merged columns.
    - Fixed problem with disappearing dropdown controls on mobile devices in case of zoomed in
      pages.
    - Fixed problem with AutoComplete in the Android 4.4.2 Browser where typed characters 
      can be swapped.

Build Number 5.20143.35        Build Date: 02/09/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved the grouping logic of paged CollectionViews to avoid splitting groups
      between pages and to include all items in aggregates (as opposed to items in
      the current page which was the previous behavior; TFS 139570).
    - Added a CollectionView.sortConverter property. The property specifies a function
      that can be used to customize the sorting behavior of the CollectionView.
    - Improved FlexGrid sorting to take dataMaps into account. Now the grid sorts based
      on display value (as opposed to raw data values which was the previous behavior).
    - Expanded grid keyboard handling: now ctrl+home and ctrl+end navigate to the
      first and last cells on the grid (as opposed to home/end, which navigate to the
      first and last cells on the current row).
    - Added Gauge.origin property. This property determines the starting point used
      for painting the pointer range. Setting it to null causes the gauge to use
      the min property or zero if the range extends from negative to positive values.
    - Clamp InputNumber value between min/max as the user types the value in.
    - Improved behavior of input controls on touch devices.
* Bug fixes
    - Fixed problem with FlexChart updating after changing collection (TFS 107253).
    - Fixed problem with FlexPie bound to CollectionView with currentPosition=-1 (TFS 106270).
    - Fixed problem with calculating axis limits in stacked chart with series that has
      custom chart-type (TFS 106988).
    - FlexPie labels rendered correctly when offset > 0 (TFS 105891).
    - Fixed problem with FlexChart axis minor ticks and grid lines (TFS 101264, 101401).

=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added initialization options to wijmo.grid.Column constructor
    - Changed default color in InputColor and ColorPicker to white

Build Number 5.20143.25      Build Date: 12/10/2014
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added frozenRows and frozenColumns properties to the FlexGrid.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.24      Build Date: 12/10/2014
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added InputColor and ColorPicker controls to wijmo.input module.
    - Added toHsb, toHsl, fromHsb, fromHsl methods to Color class.
    - Improved Globalize.formatNumber to honor the 'd' format as per the .NET spec.
      (e.g. Globalize.formatNumber(-1234, 'D6') == '-001234')
    - Added chart axis minor ticks and grid lines
      ('minorTickMarks', 'minorGrid' props in Axis class).
    - Added wijmo.chart.Axis.origin property
      This property allows to specify axis position inside plot area.
    - Added 'initialized' event and 'isInitialized' boolean property to Angular directives
      and Knockout Bindings. The property gets a true value and event is triggered after
      the directive has finished initialization of the control with values defined in
      its attributes and child directives.

* Bug fixes
    - CollectionView did not raise itemChanged when removing the current item
      and preserving the current position.

    - Fixed problem with column/bar width when using x-value data(TFS 97589). 

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.23      Build Date: 11/25/2014
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Removed Wijmo 5 dependency on jQuery.
        Starting with this version, Wijmo 5 has no dependencies on external libraries.
    - Added wijmo.grid.Column.showDropDown property
        This option adds drop-down buttons to cells.
        Clicking the button brings up a list based on the column's dataMap.
        This feature requires the wijmo.input module.

* Bug fixes
    - Improved handling of star-sized columns in auto-sized grids; previously the grid
      could sometimes leave room on the right for a scrollbar that wasn't there.

* Breaking changes
    - Calling the wijmo.grid.DataMap constructor with an itemsSource but no selectedValuePath
      or displayMemberPath parameters used to create integer keys for the values; now the 
      array values are used both as values and as keys; this is more convenient for creating
      lists of strings that can be used with drop-downs and avoids the creation of arbitrary
      (and meaningless) keys.
