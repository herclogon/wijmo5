RowDetails (Angular 2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows how to add row details to FlexGrid controls.

The FlexGridDetailProvider extension allows you to customize the data 
presentation by adding a row details section.

Adding a row details section enables you to group some data in a template 
that is optionally visible or collapsed. For example, you can add row 
details to a FlexGrid that presents only a summary of the data for each 
row, but presents more data when the user selects a row.

You can define the template for the row details section in code or directly
in markup, using the "wjFlexGridDetail" directive on the "template" element.
